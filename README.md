galimatias
==========

galimatias is a URL parsing and normalizing library written in Java.

Design goals:

- Parse URLs as browsers do.
- Stay as close as possible to WHATWG's [URL Standard](http://url.spec.whatwg.org/). In fact, the aprser is largely based on it.
- Convenient API.
- Immutable URL objects.
- Fast.
- Zero dependencies.

Non-goals:

- Be nit-picky about standards if that conflicts with the first goal.
- Provide networking capabilities.
